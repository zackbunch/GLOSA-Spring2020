# Green Light Optimized Speed Advisory

The highest fuel consumption on urban arterials is associated with driving in congested traffic, characterized by higher speed fluctuations and frequent stops at intersections. One way to reduce excessive stop-and-go driving on urban streets is to optimize signal timings. More recently, new methods in traffic signal optimization have incorporated changes in drivers' behavior to achieve optimum performance at signalized intersections. Connected vehicles technology provides a two-way wireless communication environment enabling vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, which can be used for a variety of mobility and safety applications. One such application is called the green light optimized speed advisory (GLOSA). This system uses timely and accurate information about traffic signal timing and traffic signal locations to guide drivers (through infrastructure-to-vehicle communication) with speed advice for a more uniform commute with less stopping time through traffic signals.
